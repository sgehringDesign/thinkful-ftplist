# Thinkful.com Exercise: Moving List Items   

####Technology
HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery

####Exercise Instructions
I experimented with creating 3 buckets of bootstrap lists-items (Dev Bucket, Stage Bucket, Production Bucket) and using button controls to move the list items from on bucket to another.

####Future Enhancements
- I would like to add a search suggest for each bucket
- I would like to design and add buttons to the bottom that will test and run a deployment
- I would like to rework the list-itmes to be a grid so the user can do more complicated sorting
